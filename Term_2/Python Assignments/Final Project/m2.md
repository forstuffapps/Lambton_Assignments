# Code Explain

1. np.linspace to generate random number between  `0 to 10` with an interval of 50 i.e 50 equally spaced points between 0 and 10 it generates numbers like **_0.2,0.4,0.6_** ..

2. I have customized the plots using lables, color,linestyle, title. I used color yellow for the line and red for the histogram and linestyle as dashed for the line and have given title as "Line Graph" and `"histogram"` also used label named `"x-axis "` for the line.
