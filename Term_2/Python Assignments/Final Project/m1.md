The above Python code uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to generate a simple line plot of 10 randomly generated integers. The plot is then displayed using the plt.show() function and saved to a PNG file using the plt.savefig() function.

First, the necessary libraries are imported with the statements import numpy as np and import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. The title of the plot is set to "Avinash project" with the line plt.title("Avinash project").

Next, an array of 10 random integers between 0 and 100 is generated using the NumPy function np.random.randint(100, size=10) and assigned to the variable x.

The background color of the plot is set to a dark shade of purple with the line ax.set_facecolor("#221E22").

Then, the plot is generated with the line plt.plot(x, marker='o', color='#ECA72C'). This line creates a simple line plot of the values in x, with circular markers at each data point and a line connecting the points. The color of the markers and line is set to a bright gold color using the color='#ECA72C' argument.

The plot is then displayed on the screen using the plt.show() function. Finally, the plot is saved to a PNG file named "chart.png" using the plt.savefig('chart.png') function.

Overall, this code generates a simple line plot with random data and custom colors for the markers and background.
