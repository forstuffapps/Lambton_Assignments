# Explaination of the Code

1. This code generates a figure with two subplots using the `subplot2grid()` function from Matplotlib.

2. In the first subplot, a one-dimensional **NumPy** array x with 30 random integers between 0 and 99 is generated using the `np.random.randint(100, size=30)` function. The data is then plotted with circular markers and a red color using the plot() function. The `xlabel()` and `ylabel()` functions are used to set the labels for the x and y axes, respectively.

3. In the second subplot, a one-dimensional NumPy array y with 10 random integers between 0 and 99 is generated using the `np.random.randint(100, size=10)` function. The data is plotted with small dots and a light gray color using the `plot()` function.

4. The `ax.set_facecolor("#07020D")` function sets the background color of the second subplot to a dark purple color.

5. Finally, the `savefig()` function is used to save the figure as a PNG image, and the `show()` function is called to display the figure on the screen.

6. Overall, this code generates two subplots with different sets of random data and customizes the appearance of each subplot by setting different marker styles, colors, and background colors.
