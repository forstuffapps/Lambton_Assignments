          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p class="sd_highlight">
            Hillier Fryers Ltd. was founded in the early 1900s by John Hillier.
            At the time, John was a young engineer who was passionate about
            cooking. He developed a deep fryer that was made entirely of
            stainless steel and had oil filtration to ensure that the fried food
            was uniform in temperature and taste. The upgraded thermostat also
            ensured that the deep fryer would automatically turn off when the
            desired temperature was reached. John's deep fryer was a hit among
            home cooks, and soon he was manufacturing them for commercial use as
            well. Today, Hillier Fryers Ltd. is still a leading manufacturer of
            deep fryers, and its products are used by restaurants and households
            all over the world.
          </p>
